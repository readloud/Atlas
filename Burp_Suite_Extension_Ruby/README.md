# Burp Suite Extension | Ruby Templates

![](burp-ruby.png)

## What? 

This repository is a collection of templates of Burp Suite Extensions, focusing on [Burp suite API](https://portswigger.net/burp/extender/api/) functionalities and simplifying Java language consuming through JRuby.

Here, we're trying to make it a simple as possible. You Just focus on your idea and save time tons of times searching for examples and extensions.

## Why? 

Due the lake of examples and implementations of Burp Extension using Ruby, I've decided to make it easy for all rubyists to have a confident and quick start to build useful extension for InfoSec community. This repository with NO doubt will speed up building your Burp Extension using Ruby. This is a part of **@Rubyfu (Rubyfu.net)** goals of filling the gab of Ruby existence upon InfoSec community.

## How? 

There are couple of news here, one is good and one is bad:

**The good news is**, all written extensions whether its written in Java, Ruby or Python are identecally useful resources to you.

**The Bad news is**, you've to read and understand a *bit* of Java. And that's the key of the good news though ;) 



**Note:** Some extensions have been supported with animated screenshots for clarity before use.
