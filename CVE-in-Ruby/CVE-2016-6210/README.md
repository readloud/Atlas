# CVE-2016-6210 | OpenSSHd user enumeration
OpenSSH crypto library could be exploited by a remote attacker to enumerate users on systems running SSHD. An attacker can exploit the bug to check whether user names are valid on a server exposed online, the issue exists in most systems where the Blowfish algorithm runs faster than SHA256/SHA512.

By sending large passwords, a remote user can enumerate users on systems that run SSHD. This problem exists in most modern configuration due to the fact that it takes much longer to calculate SHA256/SHA512 hash than BLOWFISH hash.‚Äù states the abstract for the flaw in the OpenSSH.

**Valid users will result in higher total time**

# Usage
Here your write the exploit help message or it's options
**Exploit**
```
ruby cve-2016-6210_exploit.rb <TARGET:PORT> <USER_LIST>
```

## PoC
Here your write the result of executing the exploit on your target

```
-> ruby cve-2016-6210_exploit.rb 172.16.16.142:22 users.list
[+] Getting non-existing '____F____' user time: 
[+] Found user: user
```

Note: Dude the vulnerability natural, exploit can't be 100% reliable.
